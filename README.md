# A Deep Dive into Caching with Service Workers

Presented at Stir Trek 2023 - https://stirtrek.com/

Service workers solve a huge problem with web applications â€“ allowing users to continue using your application even when they are offline. Many packages bill themselves as a drop-in solution for offline functionality. It just works! Until it doesnâ€™t. ðŸ¥² What to do when things go sideways? We have to dive deep! By understanding the Service Worker lifecycle, caching strategies, and pitfalls, we can equip ourselves with the necessary knowledge to get out of thorny situations. Weâ€™ll also look at ways to debug and test your service workers so you can deploy with confidence.
